# Gibberish-Generator
This is a project I did for my CS1913 Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures class.
The five primary classes that I wrote are LetterSample, CharBag, TrieNode, Trie, and Gibberisher.
The GibberisherMain class was provided by my professor but I modified it to work with multiple data sets.
Same for the Dictionary class.
